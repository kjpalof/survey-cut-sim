In a response to budget constraints, that may yield a decrease in survey areas being evaluated annually, simulations were performed to determine the influence of various survey adjustments on the regional biomass estimate.  These were evaluated for both legal and mature biomass.  The results reported here are for the estimates of total legal and mature biomass for the SE Region - they include both survey and non-survey biomass. Biomass from surveyed areas is calculated using survey CPUE and a catch-survey-analysis (CSA) model, whereas non-surveyed area biomass is expanded from the estimate of surveyed areas. 
The goal of these simulations was to determine the probably effect of removing survey areas on the estiamte of total biomass.  



### Data Used
The biomass data used in these simulations is taken from the sigma plot 'bay by bay' documents for legal biomass from each area and from the individual CSA models (historic excel files) for mature biomass from each area.  They are slightly different from those biomasses reported in annual stock health documents but are the most accurate and complete.  To better match historically reported biomasses, estimates for Glacier Bay, Thomas Bay, Port Camden, and Holkham Bay for early years without a survey were estimated to be the minimium from the survey start until 2012. These are referred to in this document as adjusted biomass estiamtes of legal and mature crab. 

The expansion percentage used from 2001 until 2014 designated 71% of the tanner biomass to be from the survey areas while 29% was from non-surveyed areas.  This percentage was calculated form historic (1980-2000) harvest records. 
It was thought that when removing survey areas that this expansion would be adjusted by the percent contribution of that survey area to historic harvest.  However, this drastically changed the biomass estimates due to the historic harvest percentages being different from each survey area's actual contribution to the biomass in most years.  Therefore, the contribution of each survey areas to the estimate of biomass was calculated for the last 10 years of the survey (2005-2015).  This percent contribution, scaled to a total of 71%, was used to in these simulations to determine the expansion factor for each area if it was removed from the survey.  

In each simulation the areas surveyed were set for all years.  Historic survey biomass was used for these areas and the overall percent contribution was determined by summing the percent contribution for each area.  Each simulation therefore, results in a time series of total biomass estimates where the survey biomass component only uses areas designated in the simulation and the non-survery biomass is expanded from the calculated survey biomass.  The simulation does NOT currently allow for variation between years of the survey areas sampled, this would be the next step.  The total biomass time series was then compared to the "known" time series (K) of total biomass.  This comparison is represented visually in a figure for each simulation (S) and as an average percent difference from the known biomass (table X).

### Simulation 1: 2015 survey areas, removed Port Camden and Port Frederick 
For the 2015 survey season the areas of Port Camden and Port Frederick were removed from the surveyed areas.  In the 2015 assessment these areas were considered part of the non-surveyed biomass.  This simulation was done to determine the overall influence of these areas on total biomass for the entire time series.  Prior to performing these simulations it was determined that these areas were very small contributors to the survey and most likely did not play a large role in determining total biomass. 

These results were validated in the simulation.  The total biomass time series was nearly identical to that using all of the survey areas.  

Average percent difference for legal biomass in Sim 1 (this should be read as 0.38%)
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE,  comment =""}
sim2015_adj <- survey_sim (dat4, areas_2015)
#paste("Average", "percent", "difference", "for", "legal", "biomass")
round(mean (sim2015_adj$per_diff[20:38])*100, 4)
```
Average percent difference for mature biomass in Sim 1
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE,  comment =""}
#ls()
sim2015mature_adj <- survey_sim_mature (dat5, areas_2015)
round(mean (sim2015mature_adj$per_diff[20:38])*100,4)

### Simulation 2: Estimating Tanner crab abundance using only RKC survey areas
This simulation uses only the red king crab survey areas to estimate the biomass for Tanner crab, it does NOT include any Tanner crab areas.  This would be an extreme example if the Tanner crab survey was cut in its entirety.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, comment=""}
simRKC2_adj <- survey_sim (dat4, areas_RKC_only)

```
Average percent difference for mature biomass in Sim 2
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, comment=""}
simRKC2mature_adj <- survey_sim_mature (dat5, areas_RKC_only)

#ls()
```

### Simulation 3: 2015 survey areas using only Tanner crab leg 1 (removing leg 2)
Simulation 3 builds off the 2015 survey areas sampled.  The next step would be to eliminate one of the Tanner crab survey legs.  In this simulation leg 2 was eliminated, this removes Thomas Bay and Holkham Bay from the surveyed areas.
